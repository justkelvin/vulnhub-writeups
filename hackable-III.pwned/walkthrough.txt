Hackable III

Nmap scan showed only port 80 open
Also a robots.txt had /config path disallowed
Dirsearch showed some folders also- /backups
                                    /imagens
                                    /css
                                    /login_page
View source of index.php showed a comment - a possible username and talked about port knocking
    username - jubiscleudo
    password

A login page in /login_page/login.html  seemed to be vulnerable to something, sqli - entering ' or 1=1 showed
the login.php source code
In /config we had the sql connection config file which also showed that the mysql had root login with no password

Something interesting about the login.php source code showed a redirect to 3.jpg image file which running steghide
with no password extracted a file
    1. porta:65535
    2. 10000
    3. 4444
    Maybe one of the numbers needed for port knocking.

Keep enumeration we find a base64 string in http://192.168.56.103/config/1.txt and decoding gives us another number 10000
Lets keep looking, a rare place in the css directory we had a 2.txt which had brainfuck
    ++++++++++[>+>+++>+++++++>++++++++++<<<<-]>>>------------------....
    Decoding it gave us 4444

    knock 192.168.56.103 10000 4444 65535

    nmap -p22 ip - and its now open

So what next - in backups folder we found a wordlist - lets try it with hydra with the username in the source
We managed to login-
I found another user in the system - so i looked for a way to access
Running LinPeas showed a /var/www/html/.backup_config.php and it seemed intersting
Looking more in LinPeas we get:
    define('DB_PASSWORD', 'TrOLLED_3');
    define('DB_USERNAME', 'hackable_3');
    define('DB_PASSWORD', '');
    define('DB_USERNAME', 'root');
Lets try the creds
    user - hackable_3
    pass - TrOLLED_3

A lot of googling broght to me that lxd and lxc bnaries where there and the user hackable_3 was in the lxd group
I followed a tutorial in hacktricks ablout lxd-privilege-escalation

Got root finally... Not Bad
